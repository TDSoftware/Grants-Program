## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

IPFS is a web3 solution to store and provide big-sized and not structured data. The datas address is based on it's content (CID: Content Identifier), which guarantees that the content or file isn't changed or manipulated in any way. The same CID will always point to the same content spread in the IPFS network. Currently there is no satisfying way of an integration for IPFS on Substrate blockchains. An example use case are NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens): An NFT for instance might be linked to an external artwork (image, audio file, video file, ...) that is stored within IPFS.

This is a follow-up project for [Substrate IPFS Utilities](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1187) MS1 and MS2. During the previous project some issues occurred that are related to already existing IPFS APIs and patterns used. Goal of this project is to solve those issues and make the IPFS integration ready for real use cases.

### Overview

Currently, the easiest way to record IPFS CIDs on a Substrate-based blockchains, is to call an extrinsic and pass the IPFS CID as an input parameter to store it on chain. So two separate steps are necessary:

1. Add (artwork) file to IPFS to retrieve CID
2. Store CID for NFT on chain

Because this are two separate actions to be performed by a client, we cannot consider this to be secure.
In the second step we cannot verify that the previously uploaded content in the IPFS network is the correct wanted one.

The implementation of a solution for the scenario described above, was done in MS1 and MS2 of the [Substrate IPFS Utilities](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1187) project.

Unfortunately, when adding the file (bytes) to IPFS via an extrinsic, the file size is limited by the block size of the blockchain. This is a big issue as it blocks us from using IPFS with a Substrate chain for our product [NiftyMarket](https://www.niftymarket.com). 
We made some research and came up with a solution: This project is about the implementation of this solution. 

### Project Details

The implementation developed in this project will be based on the existing IPFS implementation from TDSoftware:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/TDSoftware/substrate-ipfs](https://github.com/TDSoftware/substrate-ipfs)

Here a rough overview about the components and communication flow:
![Image](https://tdsoftware-dev.de/w3f-grant-program/ipfs-util-2.png)

The problem with the current implementation is, that the bytes of the file added are passed to an extrinsic. With that the block size limit will limit the file size too. It is then impossible to upload bigger files, which is of course a requirement of an IPFS integration into Substrate.

Our solution consists of using the RPC API to receive an incoming file. Then generating the CID of the content and store it in the Substrate off-chain storage. Together with some related metadata (depending one use case: e.g. NFT) an extrinsic is call to store the CID with the metadata and the status "In Progress".

When the TDS IPFS off-chain worker is invoked, it fetches the file from the off-chain storage and adds it to the local IPFS node. At last we need to update the status of the CID on chain to "Done". A running IPFS node and communication logic was implemented in Milestone 1 and 2. So this project will focus on the off-chain storage usage implementation with an RPC API.

### Ecosystem Fit

The implementation helps people using IPFS with Substrate, this is a common scenario.
Especially for NFT products this solution is helpful to avoid external middleware implemetations taking action. Having the whole logic for minting NFTs with related content inside Substrate makes it easier to maintain and more secure.

There are similar projects dealing with IPFS and Substrate, but all do have the issue of the block size limits. That makes those implementation not usable for real world scenarios.

## Development Status :open_book:

A concept and solution draft was created as part of this application and can be found in the Project Details chapter. We took time on Milestone 1 and 2 to discuss and discover issues and find solutions.
